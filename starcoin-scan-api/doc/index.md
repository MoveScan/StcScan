#Introduction

    Welcome to the Starcoin SCAN APIs documentation ðŸš€.

**Stcscan** is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for **Starcoin**.
As a means to provide equitable access to blockchain data, we've developed the Stcscan Developer APIs to empower developers with direct access to Starcoin's block explorer data and services via GET/POST requests.
Stcscan's APIs are provided as a community service and without warranty, so please use what you need and no more.

#API Endpoints
Your app may need to show a user's ERC-20 token holdings and their USD value  , check if a transaction has been mined  or get the latest gas price estimates  .
For that you may find a suitable endpoint from our wide range of APIs that you can simply query to provide data while you remain fully focused on building your applications.
Etherscan offers 2 types of API plans, a set of free community endpoints and API PRO which consists of additional derived blockchain data.
